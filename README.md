# ThreadStorm
The goal of this project is to create a distributed task scheduling system that allows multiple clients to connect to a server via sockets. Specialized workers will be used to perform tasks submitted by clients and connected to the server via RMI
The goal of this project is to create a distributed task scheduling system that allows multiple clients to connect to a server via sockets. Specialized workers will be used to perform tasks submitted by clients and connected to the server via RMI. Proposed tasks include using filters and convolution to process images, as well as displaying a curve of temperature and humidity variation read from a sensor. A special worker will be dedicated to reading data from an Arduino sensor.
